* Tasks

** TODO Fix peices overshooting the highest bottom position

** TODO Start the game with a different seed

** Add flags to control how the program runs

** TODO Make a start screen

** TODO Need an ending screen

** TODO Record each even and replay those events

** TODO Fix rotation on the sides of the board to keep the shape on the board
   Rotating a Z piece by the right side of the board cause the right
   side of the peice to go outside the board.

** TODO Fix how consuming keys effects different commands
   Right now keys are consumed at 1/10 a second.  Faster rates cause a
   long key press to repeat, and short causes sequences of key
   commands to be skipped because only one key command every 1/10th a
   second is captured and executed.

** TODO Draw board possible with vertical grid alignment

** TODO Make an options screen

** TODO Add sounds
   - Music to jam-out to when playing the game
   - Sound when the block hits the bottom or land on the stack
   - Satisfying row completion sounds for 1,2,3,4 rows completed at once
   - Game over wah-wah-uh-oh sound
