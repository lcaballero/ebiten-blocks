* Tasks

** TODO Add sounds
*** DONE Sound when the block hits the bottom or land on the stack
*** TODO Music to jam-out to when playing the game
*** TODO Satisfying row completion sounds for 1,2,3,4 rows completed at once
*** TODO Game over wah-wah-uh-oh sound

** TODO Make a start screen

** TODO Need an ending screen

** TODO Record each event and replay those events

** TODO Make rotation on sides of board move piece closer to center

** TODO Fix how consuming keys effects different commands
   Right now keys are consumed at 1/10 a second.  Faster rates cause a
   long key press to repeat, and short causes sequences of key
   commands to be skipped because only one key command every 1/10th a
   second is captured and executed.

** TODO Draw board possible with vertical grid alignment guides

** TODO Make an options screen

* Nice to Haves

** TODO Possibly keep a record of personal best scores

* Completed

** DONE Prevent movement left or right if it would cause a colision
   Fixed the colision detection when moving left and right.
** DONE Fix rotation on the sides of the board to keep the shape on the board
   Rotating a Z piece by the right side of the board cause the right
   side of the peice to go outside the board.
** DONE Add flags to control how the program runs
   New flags have been added to control the =seed=, and although not yet
   used, there is a =dev-mode= flag.
** DONE Start the game with a different seed
   There is now a new flag =--seed= to provide a specific seed and also
   keeps the default seed when the flag is not present.
** DONE Fix peices overshooting the highest bottom position
   Once the peice has colided or exited the board a final position is
   done that moves the current piece to the top of the stack.
** DONE Add more to the score based on the number of lines captured
** DONE Adjust velocity of new blocks at each level
** DONE Make score board level up after every 10 lines captured
** DONE Add pieces to the board when it has reached it's final position
** DONE When a row is cleared update/add to the score   
** DONE Implement clearing a row when it is completed
** DONE Make pressing 'down' cause piece to race to the bottom

* Open Source

** TODO Contribute to the open source project Ebiten
