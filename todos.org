* Tasks

** TODO Record each even and replay those events

** TODO Fix rotation on the sides of the board to keep the shape on the board
   Rotating a Z piece by the right side of the board cause the right
   side of the peice to go outside the board.

** TODO Fix how consuming keys effects different commands
   Right now keys are consumed at 1/10 a second.  Faster rates cause a
   long key press to repeat, and short causes sequences of key
   commands to be skipped because only one key command every 1/10th a
   second is captured and executed.

** TODO Draw board possible with vertical grid alignment

* Completed

** DONE Add more to the score based on the number of lines captured
** DONE Adjust velocity of new blocks at each level
** DONE Make score board level up after every 10 lines captured
** DONE Add pieces to the board when it has reached it's final position
** DONE When a row is cleared update/add to the score   
** DONE Implement clearing a row when it is completed
** DONE Make pressing 'down' cause piece to race to the bottom

* Open Source

** TODO Contribute to the open source project Ebiten
