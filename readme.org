* Purpose
  This is a tetris clone done from scratch to gain some experience
  with the [[https://ebitengine.org/][ebiten]] engine.

  There are a handful of known bugs not yet fixed as of 2023-03-22.

* Getting Started
  Use the =run.sh= script to build and run the project.  It requires a
  machine with Go 1.19 installed and setup.

  Add =$GOPATH/bin= to your path for convenience.

  #+begin_src shell
    export PATH="$GOPATH/bin:$PATH"
  #+end_src

  Then in a terminal, navigate to this directory and run the following
  command:

  #+begin_src shell
    go mod tidy && ./run.sh build && ebiten-01
  #+end_src

  That should pull down the project dependencies, write the built
  executable to =$GOPATH/bin/= and then execute the command.
